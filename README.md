# CS330-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for CS 330

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by focusing on clarity and scalability. My design begins with outlining the core functionality, followed by building modular components that can be reused and expanded. I prioritize clean architecture, making it easy to modify or upgrade the system later.

New design skills: This project has improved my ability to balance aesthetic choices with functional requirements, especially when working with 3D scenes. I learned to emphasize simplicity in early iterations and gradually add complexity.

Design process followed: I began by sketching a rough idea of the 3D scene I wanted to create, followed by a process of refining object models, lighting, and textures. I ensured to incorporate user interaction in a way that complemented the visual design without overcomplicating the structure.

Application to future work: These design tactics, such as breaking a large project into smaller, manageable tasks, can be applied in future software projects—whether building user interfaces, games, or even handling complex data visualizations.

How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I focus on iterative refinement and testing. I break down the project into smaller parts, coding each component individually and ensuring its functionality before moving on. This allows me to detect and fix errors early, reducing the need for major rework later.

New development strategies: For the 3D scene, I used incremental rendering checks and early lighting adjustments to improve the scene as I went along, which saved time and made debugging easier.

Role of iteration: Iteration was essential, especially when adjusting lighting and textures to achieve the desired effect. Repeatedly testing and refining the scene’s elements allowed me to enhance the final product without getting overwhelmed by trying to perfect everything in one go.

Evolution of code development: My approach evolved through the milestones, as I gained a better understanding of rendering optimizations, object positioning, and managing scene complexity. Early on, I worked more on learning the tools, but by the end, my focus shifted to refining the user experience and visual appeal.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Educational Pathway: Computational graphics and visualizations have broadened my perspective on how visual data can enhance understanding in various fields, from scientific research to game development. These skills will help in future coursework that involves complex data representation or creating engaging simulations.

Professional Pathway: Professionally, the ability to create 3D visualizations can be applied in numerous industries such as architecture, virtual reality, and even marketing. Understanding how to manipulate 3D environments and visuals can give me a competitive edge in fields that require a blend of technical and creative expertise.
